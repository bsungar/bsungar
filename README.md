# Hi There :v:	 
I am Beyza Sungar. I am studying at Manisa Celal Bayar University in Computer Engineering department. I am currently researching software areas that interest me, and I am 
trying to learn programming languages for these software areas. I'm happy whenever I see my progress in learning programming languages, and I also enjoy what I'm doing when my code is running. I love studying for coding. :sparkling_heart:
